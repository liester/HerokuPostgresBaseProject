# HerokuPostgresBaseProject
Base project for when I want to quickly template out a Spring Boot application to run on Heroku

I constantly found myself trying to modify one of my other projects to create a 'clean' project for a new idea.  Finally I had enough can decided that it would be much easier to simply commit a project that had my normal defaults to github and simply clone this project when necessary.

I also created an archetype to do this but as I didn't want to go through the pain of uploading the archetype to the maven repository this seemed like a good alternative.

To try it out:

`Checkout project`

`Add environment variable for: DATABASE_URL & MAX_DB_CONNECTIONS`

`Run as Java Application (Main class is com.perry.config.MainApplication) `
